Overview

Anything that's logged can be visualized and connected with other things hat's been logged.

Aim observability Pythonic SDK allows to truly connect the dots in the AI Systems. From ML experiments to production to LangChain traces to AI System Monitoring.

UI Components can be found in the default Docs App.


Boards
======
The Aim Boards are the fundamental building block of any kind of aim-based observability layer.
They are the main UI component that allows to visualize the logged data.
Boards are composed of UI components and data retrieval.
Boards can be reused between themselves. Each page is also a board.
