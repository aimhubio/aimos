As AI Engineers, AI Infra developers we use logging apps all the time:

- Experiment Tracking
- AI System tracing
- AI System monitoring
- AI System debugging

These are just a few examples of logging apps.

**Logging apps are the visualization tools that are built on top of logged data for observability and debugging purposes.**

Aim is an open-source operating system for logging apps.
Aim helps create and run logging apps. Those apps are packaged as regular Python Packages. 

Therefore these apps can be published and distributed with the Python Distribution tools like PyPI.

when apps are run with Aim, they appear in the Apps section of the Aim UI.
